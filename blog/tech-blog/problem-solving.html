        <h3>Were blocked on a simple problem</h3>
          <p>
            Once, I got stuck on a seemingly simple problem that I kept looking at for ages. 
            I tried commenting it out and rewriting the code in a different way, but it still wasn't working. 
            Eventually, I decided to step away from my computer and take a break because I wasn't making any progress. 
            After coming back 30 minutes later, I immediately noticed a typo that was causing the issue. 
            This experience taught me to take breaks more often because there's no point in staring at the screen stressed out.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Elegantly solved a problem</h3>
          <p>
            I had some trouble with the deBee challenge in JavaScript kata. At first, I was confused about what I was trying to accomplish. So, I looked through the challenge and checked out the test file to get an idea of what I needed to code.
            Then, I broke down the steps of what I wanted to write using pseudocode. I read it out loud to get a clearer picture. Even after that, I struggled to write the code because I wasn't familiar with methods like filter() or replace(). But, console logging helped me along the way.
            Eventually, I was able to get the code right and passed the test. I even tried to write the new code in a different way to pass the test, as I had a few ideas to achieve this challenge.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>
            I'm still not very confident when it comes to writing pseudocode because I struggle to determine which methods to use for each piece of code. 
            Nonetheless, breaking down the problem into smaller steps using pseudocode can make the coding process easier.
          </p>
        <h4>Trying something</h4>
          <p>
            I think my current approach to coding is to try out different solutions. 
            I begin by writing code that makes sense to me, and if it doesn't work, I go back and fix it. 
            This method helps me learn by doing and is a good way for me to start coding.
          </p>
        <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
          <p>
            As mentiond above. I put myself as a rubber duck. I simply talk to myself and see if I understand what I'm saying.
            I've used this method on many other things throughout my life and it has proven to work.
            (I only do this when I'm alone though. so I don't look crazy)
          </p>
        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
          <p>
            When I code, I tend to write it based on my intuition. 
            As a result, reading error messages becomes an essential tool for me. 
            I rely on error messages often to help me identify what's wrong and to fix it.            
          </p>
        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
          <p>
            Personally, I rely heavily on console logging when coding. 
            It helps me keep track of the code's history and identify where any errors may be occurring.
            I tend to use it after each line of code to ensure I understand what's going on.
          </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
          <p>
            To be honest, I rely heavily on Google when it comes to coding. 
            I search for everything, even the simplest things. 
            It's a great way for me to refresh my memory or learn something new, and I also get inspired by how other developers approach similar problems.
          </p>
        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
          <p>
            I often ask many questions to my home group facilitator, David, who is always helpful and kind. 
            However, I try not to ask for the answer outright, but instead ask for hints so I can challenge myself to figure it out on my own.
          </p>
        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
          <p>
          I haven't asked my peers for help since we are all at different stages of learning. 
          They might not have reached the same challenge as me, and I don't want to make them feel like they are behind.
          </p>
        <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
          <p>
            To be honest, journaling is not really my thing.
            However, I do occasionally jot down some notes on a notepad to revisit later. 
            Before bed, I review these notes and use Google or watch tutorial videos to better understand any topics I may have struggled with.
          </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes, I find myself overthinking about what others might think of me. 
            I worry that my peers might judge me for asking questions they already know the answers to or for asking questions they consider to be stupid. 
            However, I am aware that these thoughts are not always true, and I try to remind myself that I am still in the process of learning and to maintain a growth mindset.
