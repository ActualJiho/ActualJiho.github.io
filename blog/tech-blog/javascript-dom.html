        <h3>HTML vs CSS vs Javascript</h3>
        <p>HTML is like the builder of a house. They are the one laying the foundation and building the sturction of the house. Just like in web development HTML is responsible for building the structure of the page.</p>
        <p>Whereas CSS is like the designer. They are responsible for adding style and asthetics to the house that HTML/Builder built. Such as painting the house and selecting type of flooring. In web development, CSS is responsible for adding styles like fonts,colors and positioning.</p>
        <p>Finally, Javascript can be compared to plumber or electrician. They make sure all the plumbing and wiring is connected together and working properly. Such as pipes, gas, drains, lights and so on. In web development Javascript makes the page dynamic.</p>

        <h3>Control flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>Control flow is like a schedule or recipe that tells a computer what to do step by step.</p>
        <p>For example, we can use the process of going to work each day:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Wake up and get ready</li>
          <li>Get in the car</li>
          <li>Drive to work</li>
          <li>Do work</li>
          <li>Drive back home</li>
          <li>Get cleaned and go to sleep</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>We can also use the same example to explain loops. A loop is a programming construct that tells the computer to repeat a specific set of instructions multiple times. </p>
        <p>Using the same example, a loop would be like telling someone to repeat the above process of going to work until they run out of gas.</p>
        <p>In javascript, we can set it's starting point, end point(so it doesn't loop indefinitely) and what actions to take during the loops.</p>

        <p>p.s Imagine going through that loop ðŸ¤·.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Document Object Model(DOM)</h3>
        <p>DOM is a map for web developers. It will show all the different parts of the web page. It will help us developers to change or move stuff on the web using a tool called Javascript.</p>
        <p>I can give you an example. If a web page has a button and when clicked change its colour. For web developer we can use the DOM to tell the program to listen to that click and to change the color of the button.</p>
        <p>Obiously this is one of many examples out there. Javascript has many different functions we can utilise to make interactive things on a web page. </p>

        <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <p>Arrays are like box full of drill bits. As they are numbered you can easily find the right size you are looking for.</p>
        <p>Unlike the example I've given you, javascript starts counting the items from 0 instead of 1. so if we have 5 values in an array. it would count them as 0,1,2,3,4 instead of 1,2,3,4,5</p>
        <img class="blog-content-img" src="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/JavaScript-Array.svg">
        <p>Now let's talk about objects. Objects can be compared to a tool drawer with name labels on each drawers so you can open the right drawer.For example, you might have a drawer labeled "screwdrivers" and another labeled "allen keys". Each drawer would contain the tools that match its label, </p>
        <p>It's the same in javascript where an object contains a properties that describe its value.</p>
        <p>In javascript, you have the ability to modify objects by adding, changing, or removing their properties. which are like the different tools in a tool drawer that can be swapped out or replaced. </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>Functions are sets of instructions for Javascript to follow. Following the other two analogy I've given you above for arrays and objects, javascript can be compared to a  power drill.</p>
        <p>Power drill is a tool that is used with different drill bits to perform many different tasks. Just like in Javascript we use function to perform different tasks and it depands on what arguments are passed on to it.</p>
        <p>Function can be reused later on the time when needed, like how power drill can be stored and used many times.</p>
