        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>I have discovered that embracing a growth mindset has positive effects beyond learning. One of these effects is that I tend to have a more positive outlook on life, which makes me more open to taking on challenges. By reminding myself that I have the potential to grow and improve, I am more motivated to overcome obstacles and achieve my goals.</p>
        <p>Secondly, Active listening has enabled me to better understand others and empathise with their emotions, resulting in improved communication. By focusing my attention on what others are saying, I can better comprehend their perspective and respond appropriately. This helps to establish rapport and build trust with others, leading to stronger relationships and more effective communication.</p>
        <p>Finally Te Whare Tapa WhƒÅ highlights the importance of taking care of oneself holistically, including physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. By prioritising my own wellbeing, I am able to focus better on my studies.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>Values play a crucial role in shaping our lives by providing a solid direction and purpose. They are fundamental principles that guide our thoughts, behaviours, and decisions. By recognising and prioritising our values, we can make intentional choices that align with our beliefs and create a meaningful life.</p>
        <p>Empathy is a valuable trait that enables us to connect with others on a deeper level and communicate effectively. As someone who has worked in customer service, I have found that practicing empathy allows me to understand and relate to customers' needs and concerns, resulting in more positive interactions. When we are empathetic, we can validate others' emotions and perspectives, fostering better relationships and ultimately, enhancing our personal and professional lives.</p>
        <p>Self-awareness is a critical component of a healthy mindset. It involves understanding our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, as well as how they impact ourselves and others. By developing self-awareness, we can identify our strengths and weaknesses, recognise patterns in our thinking and behaviour, and make positive changes accordingly. This can lead to increased self-confidence, improved relationships, and a greater sense of fulfilment in life.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
        </h3>
        <p>My perspective tends to lean towards positivity, and as a result, I have found that practicing mindfulness exercises has increased my ability to focus on my studies. By thinking positively, I am able to approach challenges with an open mindset, which helps me overcome roadblocks and reach my goals.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>It can be challenging to stick to my learning plan which includes activities such as daily exercise or mindfulness. While it's important to try my best to follow the plan I have set, it's also important to recognise that life can be unpredictable and may not always go as I have planned.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>I think it's because employers want more than just technical skills from programmers - they also value strong communication and teamwork abilities. As students, it's important to develop a growth mindset, understand our strengths and weaknesses, and work on improving our communication and teamwork skills alongside our technical skills. By doing so, we can better prepare ourselves for success in the workforce and be seen as valuable assets to employers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>Despite having doubts from time to time, understanding myself has been beneficial not only for my studies but also in my daily life. By knowing myself better, I am able to communicate more effectively with others, take breaks from programming, and discover my true identity.</p>
