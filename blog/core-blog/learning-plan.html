          <h3>Long-term goal and career pathway</h3>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to secure a development job in the tech industry. After experiencing the frustration of working with a problematic system at my current job, I became interested in programming and realized that I could potentially fix the issue myself. I am excited about the possibilities of developing my skills and becoming proficient in programming, which would allow me to transition into a development role. At this stage I am uncertain about the different types of developer roles available. However, I am committed to focusing on enhancing my development skills through studying and practice.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <p>- I am a self-motivated learner and enjoy taking on new challenges. Learning new things keeps me engaged and motivated to succeed.</p>
          <p>- I am an organized person and am committed to sticking to a learning plan to achieve my goals.  
          </p>  
          <br>    
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>- I have a tendency to get frustrated when I don't understand something right away, particularly when it comes to learning new concepts or tools. To overcome this, I plan to stay positive and remind myself that learning is a process that takes time and effort.</p>
          <p>- I can be a perfectionist and spend too much time on one task, which can slow down my progress. To address this, I will take short breaks and come back to the task later with fresh eyes.</p>
          <p>- As a self-directed learner, I may struggle to find answers to complex problems on my own. In such cases, I will reach out to facilitators for assistance and support.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Learning plan</h3>
          <p>To achieve my goals, I will dedicate 8 to 10 hours a day to learning and practice, adhering to a schedule similar to my former work hours. I will use online resources such as tutorial videos to reinforce my understanding of key concepts and tools. Additionally, I will strive to maintain open communication with facilitators and seek their assistance when needed. I anticipate that they will be kind and helpful, and I will make an effort to show my appreciation for their support.</p>
