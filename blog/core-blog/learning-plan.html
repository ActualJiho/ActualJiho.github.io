        <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
        <p>
          Once bootcamp comes to an end, my ultimate goal is to secure a job in the developer role.
          However, I am not yet sure which specific area of development I want to focus on. 
          For now, I am dedicating all my energy and effort into studying and learning as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the areas I am hoping to improve on is my human skills, such as working effectively with others and receiving criticism constructively. 
          In the past, I have struggled to handle negative feedback and found it difficult to work collaboratively with others. 
          However, I am determined to change this and improve my communication and teamwork skills.
        </p>  
        <p>While my strengths and limitations have not changed much from my original plan below, I have made progress in managing my stress levels. 
          This will be important as I start on the intensive bootcamp, which I am both excited and nervous about. 
          I am concerned about maintaining focus and motivation throughout the 9-week course, but I am confident that working with other students and communicating effectively will help to keep me on track.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of my expectations from the bootcamp team and facilitators, I am looking for appropriate help and guidance with clear instructions. 
          However, I am also hoping for empathy and understanding beyond just technical assistance. 
          I believe that a positive and supportive learning environment is crucial for success.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure my success, I will follow my learning plan and schedule my study time effectively. 
          Taking regular breaks and rest is also crucial to ensure that I am not overwhelmed and burnt out. 
          I will also make sure to treat others with kindness and respect, including the facilitators and fellow students. 
          Ultimately, I am committed to working hard and achieving my goals, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Long-term goal and career pathway</h3>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to secure a development job in the tech industry. 
            After experiencing the frustration of working with a problematic system at my current job, I became interested in programming and realized that I could potentially fix the issue myself.
            I am excited about the possibilities of developing my skills and becoming proficient in programming, which would allow me to transition into a development role. 
            At this stage I am uncertain about the different types of developer roles available. 
            However, I am committed to focusing on enhancing my development skills through studying and practice.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Strengths</h3>
          <p>- I am a self-motivated learner and enjoy taking on new challenges. Learning new things keeps me engaged and motivated to succeed.</p>
          <p>- I am an organized person and am committed to sticking to a learning plan to achieve my goals.  
          </p>  
          <br>    
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>- I have a tendency to get frustrated when I don't understand something right away, particularly when it comes to learning new concepts or tools. To overcome this, I plan to stay positive and remind myself that learning is a process that takes time and effort.</p>
          <p>- I can be a perfectionist and spend too much time on one task, which can slow down my progress. To address this, I will take short breaks and come back to the task later with fresh eyes.</p>
          <p>- As a self-directed learner, I may struggle to find answers to complex problems on my own. In such cases, I will reach out to facilitators for assistance and support.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>Learning plan</h3>
          <p>
            To achieve my goals, I will dedicate 8 to 10 hours a day to learning and practice, adhering to a schedule similar to my former work hours. 
            I will use online resources such as tutorial videos to reinforce my understanding of key concepts and tools. 
            Additionally, I will strive to maintain open communication with facilitators and seek their assistance when needed. 
            I anticipate that they will be kind and helpful, and I will make an effort to show my appreciation for their support.</p>
