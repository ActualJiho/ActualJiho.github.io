        <h3>My personality</h3>
        <p>According to <abbr>MBTI</abbr> (Myers Briggs Type Indicator), I am ISTJ/Logistian. You can find more about the personality type <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality">here</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How my family influenced my values and identity</h3>
        <p>Growing up, my family always emphasized the importance of honesty and being responsible. My parents would frequently remind me that telling the truth was essential, even if it meant admitting to something that I had done wrong. They taught me that being honest builds trust with others and that trust is a crucial component of healthy relationships.</p>
        <p>Additionally, they thought me to be always responsible in my actions, whether it was completing my homework on time or fulfilling my daily schedule I made. They showed me that being responsible meant following through on promises and being accountable for my actions.</p>
        <p>These values that my family instilled in me have remained with me throughout my life. I believe that honesty and responsibility are vital traits for building strong relationships, both personally and professionally. I strive to embody these values in everything that I do, and I credit my family for teaching me their importance.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Time I made an ethical decision</h3>
        <p>During my previous commission-based job, I found that a close friend and colleague was fraudulently claiming invalid commissions.</p>
        <p>As a result, our team was achieving monthly targets that we were not actually entitled to, resulting in increased commission for all of us.</p>
        <p>Despite the personal relationship, I knew that this behavior was fraudulent and had to report it to our team leader. While reporting the issue did cause some loss of individual commission, I was able to maintain my integrity and not be a part of the fraudulent behavior. In hindsight, I still believe that reporting the behavior was the right thing to do.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Working with others</h3>
        <p>At my previous job, I worked in a team where we have a daily duty to help front-line customer-facing employees. One of my colleagues, let's call her Kim, often asked rather entry-level questions on our help desk page or provided customers with incorrect information. This put the rest of the team under pressure and resulted in double handling of customer queries and requests.</p>
        <p>To address this issue, I first tried to talk to Kim privately and educate her the correct process with the correct information. However, she became defensive and denied that she was doing anything wrong.</p>
        <p>Next, I involved our team leader in the conversation and asked for his input on how we could improve our process to ensure it was followed correctly. The team leader suggested that we have a new topic to discuss in our weekly team meetings to discuss progress and identify any potential roadblocks, and assigned a mentor to work with Kim and provide guidance and support.</p>
        <p>While these strategies helped to improve the situation to some extent, there were still instances where Kim would follow the incorrect process and cause delays. In these situations, I found it helpful to stay calm and avoid blaming or shaming her, but instead offer to help and support in any way I could.</p>
        <p>Looking back, I realize that it was important to involve the team leader and seek outside help when necessary. In future situations, I would try to encourage open communication and collaboration within the team.</p>
