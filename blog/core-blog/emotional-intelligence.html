        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is a skill or ability to understand or manage their own emotions or other poeples emotions in positive way.</p>
        <p>It includes four components but are not limited to self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>EQ (Emotional Intelligence or Emotional Quotient) and IQ (Intelligence Quotient) are two types of intelligence.</p>
        <p>IQ is about how good you are at thinking and learning in school, like solving problems, remembering things, and thinking logically. It's mostly for academics and tests.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, EQ is about how well you understand and control your feelings, and how you see and deal with other people's emotions. It's about having empathy, knowing how to act in social situations, and being a good communicator. You can get better at both EQ and IQ by learning and practicing them.</p>
        <p>Some people believe that IQ measures how good you are at your job, but EQ is more important for getting along with others and talking to them in your personal and work life. IQ and EQ are both important, but studies say that EQ can help you be a better leader and make stronger relationships with people.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is important in many ways.</p>
        <p>Firstly, it enables individuals to gain a deeper understanding of their own emotions, including what triggers them and how to manage them effectively. This self-awareness is helpful in making the right decisions and appropriate responses, especially in challenging or stressful situations.</p>
        <p>Secondly, emotional intelligence leads to stronger, positive relationships as it enables individuals to understand and empathise with others' emotions, leading to better conflict resolution and effective communication.</p>
        <p>Lastly, controlling emotions enhances mental health and well-being, promoting a more positive view on life.</p>
