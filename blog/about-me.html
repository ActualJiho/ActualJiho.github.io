      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello visitors! My name is Jiho, and I live in Christchurch.</p>
      <p>Having worked in the telecommunications field for nearly a decade, I found myself yearning for something new and exhilarating, which led me to join Dev Academy. 
      <p>My lifelong aspiration has always been to discover a job that I love. Although I don't dislike my current occupation, it fails to ignite my passion.
      <p>After pondering over my long-term objectives, I have come to the realization that I want to pursue a career in technology, specifically in the developer space. This career path is highly relevant in the present and future, as technology's role and integration are only going to grow. The prospect of creating products that enhance people's lives through technology usage inspires me. I believe that the industry's focus on detail, constant evolution, and ongoing learning will provide the satisfaction I seek.</p>
      <p>I am an achiever by nature. Once I set my sights on a goal, I am committed to accomplishing it by allocating my time and resources accordingly. During my younger years, this drive to achieve could sometimes hold me back as I avoided situations where I wasn't confident of success. However, as I have matured and gained more experience, I have learned that not attaining immediate success is acceptable and can help me learn things more profoundly.</p>
